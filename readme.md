# Code Refactoring and Performance Optimization

This project is created as part of CodTech Internship Task-4.
The objective of this task is to refactor existing code to
improve readability, structure, and performance.

## Original Code Issues
- Poor variable naming
- Repeated loops
- No function usage
- Hard to read and maintain

## Refactoring Changes
- Used meaningful function names
- Removed repeated loops
- Used built-in functions like sum()
- Improved code readability

## Performance Improvement
- Reduced number of loops
- Optimized calculations
- Improved execution efficiency

## Conclusion
Refactoring improved the clarity and performance of the code.
This task helped me understand clean coding practices and
basic performance optimization techniques.
